In particular, it will concentrate on extracting data from a user-specified field on each card. The extracted data is assumed to be vocabulary and will then be displayed in a table format.  The user will have the ability to export the extracted data into a CSV file format for use in other spreadsheet programs or a PDF file for quick reference and searching.  Other information will be extracted, such as part of speech.  Users will be able to select which Anki decks information will be extracted from. The program will require the user to provide an export file from Anki that corresponds to cards made using the subs2srs template.  The program will read through the export file and save the ‘notes’ field data into an array and display it to the user in a table. While reading the Anki export file, the program will attempt to extract vocabulary using the format “word - (part of speech) definition” or, if no part of speech is included, “word - definition”.The user will be able to save the extracted information into a CSV file or pdf file for easy searching. The user will have the option to load previously created files and add newly extracted entries (the program will check to see if an entry already exists to avoid duplication).  " wrapText="true" />
